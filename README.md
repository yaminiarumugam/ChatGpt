Steps To Create ChatGPT in HTML & JavaScript

To create your own ChatGPT using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, follow these step-by-step instructions
           1.Create a folder. You can name this folder whatever you want, and inside this folder, create the mentioned files.
           2.Create an index.html file. The file name must be index and its extension .html
           3.Create a style.css file. The file name must be style and its extension .css
           4.Create a script.js file. The file name must be script and its extension .js
           5.Download and place the images folder in your project directory. This folder includes the user avatar and chatbot logo.
     
      Remember, your ChatGPT is not yet ready to generate chats based on prompts. To make it functional, you need to pay attention to a crucial detail in the code.   
Take a closer look, and you’ll notice that you have to paste an “OpenAI API key” into the API_KEY variable.
To get your API key, visit the following URL: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys. Once there, log in to your account, and you will be able to generate a free API key. To understand other things in the code.
I recommend watching the tutorial video, reading the code comments, and experimenting with the code.
